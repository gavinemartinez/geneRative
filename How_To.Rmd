How To, in geneRative.



Firstly, let's demo the creation of a circle!

```{r}

x <- create_circle(radius = 0.5)

render_lines(x)

```

Wasn't that cool!

Next, let's demo a bubble plot.

```{r}

bubble_plot(horizontal_shift = 2, background_color = "steelblue", bubble_alpha = 0.5)

```

There are many more customization you can use. We're just suckers for that steel blue and minimalist look.

Next, we want to walk you through walk_art. Get it, haha.

```{r}

walk_art(num_steps = 6600, line_thickness = 0.7)

```

This is the generate_mosaic plot. 

```{r}

generate_mosaic(num_boxes = 1600)

```

Pretty sweet right. We like to let the artwork do the talking over here. You can user input the amount of boxes you would like in addition to the spiral and background color.

And last, but certainly not least, we have shards.

```{r}

shards(iterations = 37, min = 0, max = 50)

```

You can edit the number of iterations along with the minimum and maximum for this function.
