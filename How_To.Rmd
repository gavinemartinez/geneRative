How To, in geneRative.



Firstly, let's demo the creation of a circle!

```{r}

x <- create_circle(radius = 0.5)

render_lines(x)

```

Wasn't that cool!

Next, let's demo a bubble plot.

```{r}

bubble_plot(horizontal_shift = 2, background_color = "steelblue", bubble_alpha = 0.5)

```

There are many more customization you can use. We're just suckers for that steel blue and minimalist look.

Next, we want to walk you through walk_art. Get it, haha.

```{r}

walk_art(num_steps = 6600, line_thickness = 0.7)

```

This is the generate_mosaic plot. 

```{r}

generate_mosaic(num_boxes = 1600)

```
