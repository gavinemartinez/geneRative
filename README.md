# geneRative

Hi! geneRative is a package we built in R to create, you guessed it, generative art. There six functions included, at launch, and each offers a unique way to create art. To touch on a few, we have create_circle which draws a really cool cirlce. Don't believe us, just try it out. 
Another function we've developed is bubble_plot. This creates an abstract drawing of bubbles. What's not to love? Check out the R markdown file labeled "How to" which shows some of our awesome artwork in action.

Thanks, 
The team over at geneRative
